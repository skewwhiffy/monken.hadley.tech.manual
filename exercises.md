# Exercises

Some simple exercises to practise some of things that you will need to do on the website.

## Change the noticeboard

The noticeboard on the top right of the homepage is where notices are posted for the whole school to see. It is decided that the half term dates should be hyphenated (e.g. *Monday 18th February - Friday 22nd February*) rather than linked with the word *to*.

Change it, please.

(Remember to change it back afterwards.)

## Change the staff list

The staff list on the *community* page lists the staff at the school. It has been decided that the abbreviation *Rec* for *Reception* is not self-explanatory enough.

Please change *Rec* to *Reception* on the Willow Class heading.

(Remember to change it back afterwards.)

## Change a document
