# Keeping your credentials safe

Often, you will hear conflicting advice about how to choose your password, and how to remember it.

The whole thing is a balancing act: the ideal is that all your passwords are unique, long and super difficult to remember, and that you remember each and every one of them. However, for most people, this isn't acheivable: something has to give.

There are two approaches that you can take to solving this problem, and there's not much to choose between the two of them, except the first method is probably easier.

## Use a password manager

A password manager is a piece of software that remembers all your passwords for you. The manager will use a file that has been encrypted with a password: this is the only password that you have to remember.

Additionally, a password manager will generally generate random passwords for you. This will mean that you cannot possibly forget your password (because you will never have remembered your password in the first place), and your passwords will be super difficult to guess.

### Commercial password managers

Commercially-available password managers are available that make this as painless as possible. Some offer free versions (normally with some restriction on their functionality), others are strictly paid-for.

Most of these will synchronize your passwords between your workplace, your phone, your computer and any other device that you might have.

There are several commercially-available password managers. Below are a couple you might want to try. The list is not exhaustive, others are available.

### Open-source password managers

Open-source password managers are every bit as secure as commercial ones and come with a zero price tag. The main disadvantage is that they are slightly less easy to use and/or setup. However, if you have some technical know-how, these shouldn't be too difficult to use.

Generally, to synchronize these password managers between devices, you will have to use an online backup utility (like Dropbox, OneDrive, or Google Drive) **TODO Hyperlink these up, baby**

### Build-your-own password manager

You can do this yourself. The advantage here is that you'll know exactly how your password manager works. The disadvantage here is that you may well have built a password manager that is easy to hack.
