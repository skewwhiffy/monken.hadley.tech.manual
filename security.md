# Keeping your credentials safe

Often, you will hear conflicting advice about how to choose your password, and how to remember it.

The whole thing is a balancing act: the ideal is that all your passwords are unique, long and super difficult to remember, and that you remember each and every one of them. However, for most people, this isn't acheivable: something has to give.

There are two approaches that you can take to solving this problem, and there's not much to choose between the two of them, except the first method is probably easier.

## Use a password manager

A password manager is a piece of software that remembers all your passwords for you. The manager will use a file that has been encrypted with a password: this is the only password that you have to remember.

Additionally, a password manager will generally generate random passwords for you. This will mean that you cannot possibly forget your password (because you will never have remembered your password in the first place), and your passwords will be super difficult to guess.

### Commercial password managers

Commercially-available password managers are available that make this as painless as possible. Some offer free versions (normally with some restriction on their functionality), others are strictly paid-for.

Most of these will synchronize your passwords between your workplace, your phone, your computer and any other device that you might have.

There are several commercially-available password managers. Below are a couple you might want to try. The list is not exhaustive, others are available.

* [LastPass](https://www.lastpass.com)
* [Dashlane](https://www.dashlane.com)
* [RoboForm](https://www.roboform.com)

### Open-source password managers

Open-source password managers are every bit as secure as commercial ones and come with a zero price tag. The main disadvantage is that they are slightly less easy to use and/or setup. However, if you have some technical know-how, these shouldn't be too difficult to use.

* [KeePassXC](https://keepassxc.org)
* [Password Safe](https://pwsafe.org/)

In addition to using these, you will need some way to synchronize your passwords between your devices. See below for some details.

### Build-your-own password manager

You can do this yourself. The advantage here is that you'll know exactly how your password manager works. The disadvantage here is that you may well have built a password manager that is easy to hack.

#### Password-protected spreadsheet

Excel and [LibreOffice Calc](https://www.libreoffice.org/discover/calc) give allow you to password protect a spreadsheet. If you choose a strong enough password, then this should be a reasonably safe solution. You could then synchronize your passwords with your devices in the same way as you would with the open-source password managers. See below for some details.

#### Write them down

This isn't as stupid an idea as it sounds: the idea here is that for someone to steal your passwords when you've written them down is on the same level of security as someone stealing your car keys.

However: take care if you go down this route:
* If you forget your password document, you can't log into stuff.
* Digital cameras are built into phones these days: someone can easily take a snap of your passwords without you knowing.
* Be careful to choose your passwords securely. A reasonable way is to use [four random words](https://preshing.com/20110811/xkcd-password-generator). Also, on this page is an explanation of how this is as secure as other methods.

#### Remember all your passwords

This is old-fashioned, and a little insecure for the following reasons.
* If your passwords are memorable, they're probably easy to guess.
* Online accounts are everywhere. If your passwords are different, then remembering which password goes with which site is difficult.
* The temptation to reuse passwords everywhere if you choose this route is not to be underestimated.

Don't do this unless you have a *really* **really** ***REALLY*** good memory.

### Synchronizing passwords

With commercial password managers, they generally will synchronize your passwords for you. However, you are then dependent on these companies for you passwords, and if they ever decide to squeeze revenue out of you, or go bust, this could all end in sadness for you.

With open source and roll-your-own solutions, you will generally have to organize the synchronization yourself. This is fiddly, especially for the non-technically-minded, but the end result is a solution that you are more in control of, satisfied in the fact that you've learnt to be a tech-geek. There are several solutions here.

* [Dropbox](https://dropbox.com)
* [OneDrive](https://onedrive.com)
* [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com)
* [SyncThing](https://syncthing.net) - this really isn't for the faint-hearted :).
* USB key - just make sure you make regular backups in case you lose or damage your key.
