# Changing text on the website

## General

Straight text on the website (as opposed to downloadable documents) is called *'content'* in Umbraco. Mostly, this text is pretty easy to change, but there are a few sections that are a little fiddly.

First, you need to find the text that you want to change in the backend system.

* Open the [website](https://monkenhadley.barnet.sch.uk).
* Navigate to the page that you want to change by clicking the links on the left hand side of the site.
* Log into [Umbraco](https://monkenhadley.barnet.sch.uk/umbraco) in another tab.
* In the left hand column, click on the picture of a piece of paper with a corner folded over (it should read *Content* when you hover over it).
* Chances are, the text that you want to change is under **HOME**. Expand that folder.
* Click on the subfolder corresponding to the page that you want to change.
* Keep expanding folders and clicking on subfolders until the text that you want to change is visible.
* If you can't find the text that you want to change, some pages are organized in **BOXES**. Expand the corresponding **BOXES** folder.
* If you really can't find what you're looking for, ask for help! You're not being stupid, but it will be there somewhere: I promise, looking for it will get easier with practice.

Once you have the text up in the backend, you can change it directly in the browser, taking care that the format is consistent with what was there.

* The *Preview* button is broken. Don't ask why, but fixing it is more trouble than it's worth :).
* If you mess up, you can just click away from the page. You'll get a button to *Discard changes*, which will get you out of trouble.
* If you're really panicked, just close the tab.
* Once you are happy with your changes, click on the *Save and publish* button.
* Go to the page on the live website where you have made your changes, and refresh (by pressing F5, or CTRL-R).
* If you're happy with those changes, you're done.
* If you're not, go back to the backend, and change further.
* If you've really messed up, click on *Actions* in the top left, and choose *Rollback*.
* This will give you a dropdown labelled *Rollback to* with a list of changes. Choose one that was made before you made your changes, and save and publish.
