# The missing guide to updating the Monken Hadley school website

## Overview

The [Monken Hadley Website](https://monkenhadley.barnet.sch.uk) is a site to showcase the school on the internet. It also acts as an information hub for staff and parents of students alike.

The Monken Hadley website is hosted at [Nutty About Hosting](https://www.nuttyabouthosting.co.uk). Credentials for the account there are held by the headteacher.

DNS records are hosted at [names.co.uk](https://login.names.co.uk/login). Credentials for the account there are held by the headteacher. 

**WARNING** Changing the settings for the site is dangerous: make sure you know what you are doing before making any changes to the hosting or technical settings on this account.

**WARNING** Changing the DNS settings for the site is dangerous: make sure you know what you are doing before making any changes to the DNS settings on this account.

## Accessing the system

### Getting credentials

* Get some credentials. If you don't already have credentials, you will need to ask a site administrator. If you don't know who the site administrators are, you should ask the headteacher.
* If you've forgotten your username or password, you will have to ask for a password reset from the site administrator. Although the login page seems to link to a password reset page, this is actually a lie, and it won't work: a site administrator will have to reset your password for you.
* Keep your credentials safe, have a read of [this](./security.md).
* **WARNING** DO NOT share your credentials. This would mean that someone else can make changes to the website without any accountability, and their actions will be attributable to you.

### Logging in

* Just go to the [login page](https://monkenhadley.barnet.sch.uk/umbraco).

### Changing your password

* Log in.
* **TODO**: Change your password.
